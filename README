Weema is written by Henrique Gog√≥ as a initial fork from Nick Welch's TinyWM, 2019.

Weema is a ridiculously tiny window manager implemented in nearly as few lines
of C as possible, without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  Weema's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.

Files:

  Makefile: highly advanced build system
  weema.c: the code

Usage:

  Focus follows pointer.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button2, drag: interactive window resize
  Alt+Button1 / Alt+Button2, click: raise and focus window
  Alt+Button3, click: move current window below
  Alt+Tab: alternate windows
