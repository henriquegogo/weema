Weema is written by Henrique Gog√≥ as a initial fork from Nick Welch's TinyWM, 2019.

Weema is a minimalist window manager for everyone that don't need more than just
move, resize and alternate windows. That's it.

  Makefile: highly advanced build system

  Focus follows pointer.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button2, drag: interactive window resize
  Alt+Button1 / Alt+Button2, click: raise and focus window
  Alt+Button3, click: move current window below
  Alt+Tab: alternate windows
